# LSTM Stock Forecasting Demo

This repository showcases a time-series forecasting pipeline for stock prices, using a two-layer LSTM model with PCA-based feature selection and VIX integration.  
It includes Monte Carlo simulations to estimate price uncertainty and a fully automated CI/CD deployment via GitHub Actions and Render.

## ⚙️ Automation Flow (CI/CD)

1. GitHub Actions runs `gld_prediction.py` daily
2. Fetches latest stock/VIX data → preprocess → predict
3. Outputs CSV + chart to `/Output/`
4. Touches `trigger.txt` → triggers auto-deploy on Render (Panel dashboard)
